# Valuation-of-plain-vanilla-swap

 An interest rate swap (IRS) is an over the counter (OTC) financial derivative 
where two parties agree to exchange interest rate linked cash flows on a pre- 
defined notional principal for a specified period of time and frequency. 

 The simplest (plain vanilla) interest rate swap is a swap where one party pays 
(receives) a fixed rate and receives (pays) a floating rate.

 As a result of the global financial crisis in 2008, LIBOR as a floating index is in the process of being 
 discontinued, in favour of a more reliable interest rate benchmark (e.g. SOFR), but in this particular case in order to simplefy the calculation I just used Treasury Par Yield Curve as interest rate benchmark . Day count conversion as also been ignored. 

 This calculationg is very simple and cant be used by practitioners, but i belive its a greta way to understand the idea and the way cashflows are generated for beginners like me :).
